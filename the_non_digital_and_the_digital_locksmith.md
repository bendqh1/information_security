Any locksmith, of any mathematical level, knows that there are the following type of doors:

## Doors

* **A door that is manufactured locked but cannot be unlocked**: Welded container cover.
* **A door that is manufactured locked but can only be unlocked**: Some emergency doors.
* **A door that is manufactured locked but can be both unlocked AND locked**: Some vault doors.
* **A door that is manufactured unlocked but cannot be locked**: Simple push/pull or slide doors.
* **A door that is manufactured unlocked but can only be locked**:
* A door that is manufactured unlocked but can be both locked AND unlocked.
* A door that is manufactured either way and can be either unlocked or locked and vice versa.

### Notes

* A door that is locked and cannot be unlocked could be somewhat destroyed to go through.
* Mostly regular doors and their locking mechanisms are separate products and their locking-unlocking mechanisms come unlocked by default.

## Keys

* Some keys can only lock but not unlock.
* Some keys can only unlock but not lock.
* Some keys can both lock and unlock and vice versa (dual function).
