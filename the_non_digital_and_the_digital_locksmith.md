Any locksmith, of any mathematical level, knows that there are the following type of doors:

## The non virtual world

### Doors

* **A door that is manufactured locked but cannot be unlocked**: Welded container cover.
* **A door that is manufactured locked but can only be unlocked**: Some emergency doors.
* **A door that is manufactured locked but can be both unlocked AND locked**: Some vault doors.
* **A door that is manufactured unlocked but cannot be locked**: Simple open/close/slide doors.
* **A door that is manufactured unlocked but can only be locked**: Non-retractable deadbolt; very rare kind of security door in which the bolt can be thrown (locked) from one side but cannot be retracted (unlocked) from that side (the bolt fell in the other sie) which probably uses to store very rare products. 
* **A door that is manufactured unlocked but can be both locked AND unlocked**: Standard in-house doors.
* **A door that is manufactured either way and can be either unlocked or locked and vice versa**: Standard doors in general.

#### Notes

* A door that is locked and cannot be unlocked could be somewhat destroyed to go through.
* Mostly regular doors and their locking mechanisms are separate products and their locking-unlocking mechanisms come unlocked by default.

### Keys

* **Some keys can only lock but not unlock**: Security padlocks in some industrial settings. 
* **Some keys can only unlock but not lock**: Some emergency master keys.
* **Some keys can both lock and unlock and vice versa (dual function)**: Standard door keys and keycards.

## The virtual world

The virtual world isn't much different in that context, but it has more abstract, more complicated and more mathematical concepts and devices.

The simplest example is a very long password (thousands of bytes) AND a guessing-prevention-mechanism.
